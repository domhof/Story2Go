Story2Go
========

Config
------

The device/emulator must contain a config filed called `story2go_config.xml` in `/mnt/sdcard` to load a story.

There's a `story2go_config.xml` config file in the `demo` folder.

**Steps to load the config**

1) Set a size in the SD card section of the Device Manager (e.g. 1024MB)
2) Activate File Explorer View in Eclipse
3) Navigate to `/mnt/sdcard` and upload the config with the arrow/phone icon.
