Story2Go
========

Config
------

The device/emulator must contain a config file called `story2go_config.xml` in `/mnt/sdcard` to load a story.

There's a `story2go_config.xml` config file in the `config` folder.

**Steps to load the config**

1. If you are using an emulator, set a size in the SD card section of the Device Manager (e.g. 1024MB).
2. Activate File Explorer View in Eclipse
3. Navigate to `/mnt/sdcard` and upload the config with the arrow/phone icon.
4. Also upload the audio files for the trigger points located in config/audio into the /mnt/sdcard directory.
